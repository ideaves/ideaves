- 👋 Hi, I’m @ideaves
- 👀 I’m interested in anything quantitative or numerical within the capital markets space generally. I also
- have a degree in Physics and I'm competent with weather models, Monte Carlo simulation methods, and floating
- point calculations generally. I've currently got a reasonably well developed method for teaching floating-
- point native LSTM models to predict out of sample, in a time series context. I also have a scrapy/Splash/
- implementation, and an equivalent Selenium-based C# implementation that maintain periodic (e.g. 5 minute)
- realtime futures price snapshots from your authorized web quote services.
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about some of the more interesting categorical and non-supervised AI models, but
- have not had suffient free time, or an interesting enough challenge, to prompt a lot of research.
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that supports open-source or standardized ways of executing capital-
- markets related calculations, including bespoke derivatives. I like ISDA.
- 
- 📫 I can be emailed at ideaves@yahoo.com regarding any questions, or requests for features, or bug reports.
- In bug reports, please include a) a brief description why it's a bug, and b) a way to reproduce or confirm it.
